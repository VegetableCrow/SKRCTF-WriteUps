My friend send me this file, but it does not sound like nocturne at all..
I think there is something fishy, can you find it out?

The challenge only gave us a .mid file AKA MIDI file, easy understanding is known as audio file. Open it up and listen it, it resembles morse code but when open up with audacity and decode it with red unit pitch as dot and white space as underscore. It gives me nothing in when decrypt with morse code since there is no separator between each of the unit.

# Hint :
# Notice the song is in 8 beats?

Hint says
to be continue
